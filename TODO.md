# Fix:
* Make all game thumbnails work (almost all are found and displayed, but not all)
  - Make the renderer try several file endings (.jpg, .gif etc.) instead of just.png
  - Make the renderer try several indices (count up until found or gives up) instead of just 1
* Make the "No Games Found" message not look awful
* Make the games in the game list look better (pimp 'em boii - even more yo!)

# Add:
* Load games from all LaucnhBox Platform XML files instead of just the flash one
* Make the games in the game list launchable (add a launch button? launch on double click?)
