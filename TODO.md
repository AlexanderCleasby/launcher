# Fix:
* Make the thumbnails for the games in the BrowsePage scale correctly (use the Thumbnail component?)
* Make all game thumbnails work (some are currently not found, probably because all of the are not ".png" and some characters in the title are probably formatted to work in the file system)
* Make the "No Games Found" message not look awful
* Change the background color for HomePage, AboutPage and the footer (to something dark)
* Make the games in the game list look better (pimp 'em boii)

# Add:
* Load games from all LaucnhBox Platform XML files instead of just the flash one
